👩‍💻 As a software developer and founder of Twig the Code, a non-profit organization that supports women in software development, I'm dedicated to creating a more inclusive and diverse tech industry.

🔥 My passion for technology, sports, and parenting fuels my hard work and dedication to delivering high-quality software solutions. Prior to my software development career, I worked in digital marketing for both startups and large enterprises, where I discovered my interest in the technical side of marketing.

⭐️ My work with Twig the Code has revealed the barriers many women face when trying to enter the tech industry. To help overcome these barriers, we provide coding training, development camps, networking events, and software development projects for aspiring female developers.

💫 I possess a diverse range of experience working with several key technologies, including JavaScript, Typescript, React, Groovy, and SQL. At present, I am employed as a web developer for a leading health sector company in Finland, where I am responsible for developing and maintaining their websites. In my current role, I leverage my expertise in React, Typescript, Gatsby, and Drupal to contribute to the ongoing development of the website, ensuring it remains up-to-date and responsive to the needs of its users.
